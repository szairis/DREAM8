1. the necessary input csv files exist in data/ and contain only minor formatting changes from the 
    original csv files provided in the challenge (pertaining to time point 0 stimulus labeling).

2. output will be written to a directory results/ upon running of code

3. the key parameter in this modeling strategy is the max_depth of the base learners
    used for boosting.  we tried many settings of this parameter throughout the challenge
    and we do not expect the output of this code to reproduce our final submission exactly.

4. syntax for executing subchallenge 2A code:
    python sakev-2A.py
