There are 4 components to this visualization scheme:
    1. drop-down menus for stimulus and inhibitor conditions
    2. dynamic correlation plot
    3. time series plot
    4. track windowing/control bar


1.
The user may select a particular value for the stimulus or inhibitor, or may elect to not define a
value from the drop-down menus.  If no value is indicated then the visualization will average over that
dimension in the data set.


2.
In this visualization each antibody, or node in the network, is statically positioned along a large circle
on the canvas.  The signal level for a particular antibody is represented by dynamically growing or shrinking
the size of a shaded circle centered upon its assigned initial position.  All antibody levels are re-scaled by their
mean level over the time series, and this mean is used as the radius for each antibody's dashed circle.  Having this
dashed circle always visible provides a frame of reference as the shaded circle grows/shrinks along the specified
time window.

To assist the human eye in detecting patterns between the antibody levels as they dynamically grow and shrink,
we shade in chords of the larger circle to reprsent strength/sign of correlation.  Positive/negative correlation
are encoded with blue/red respectively, and the shading thickness of the chords encode the magnitude of the correlation.


3.
When the user's mouse is moved into the shaded circle for a particular antibody, the plotting area will display time
series curves for that antibody.  Only the time points within the specified time window will be plotted and a separate
curve will be drawn for each (stimulus, inhibitor) pair.  In the mockup we see that the user specified EGF as stimulus
and all inhibitors (no selection from inhibitor menu).  Thus we plot different curves for each value of the inhibitor in the 
data set.


4.
The user can crop the series by adjusting the window start/stop brackets.  When the play button is pressed the
visualization will loop continuously over the specified time window.  The visualiztion may be paused at any
time slice by pressing the pause button.
